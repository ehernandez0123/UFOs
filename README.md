## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is o provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Summary

One drawback is that you can't really display the website on a mobile phone. It does not resize according to the devise. This would be a great improvement for the website. We would need to develop a format to be able to view the site in different devices.

Another improvement would be having a comment section where users can interact and leave a comments telling their story in the event that they saw a UFO.
